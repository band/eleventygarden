Now this file is in the github repo root directory, but still no "git:" messages in the bottom message bar.

Hmmm ....

With each new vault:
1. Install Obsidian-Git plugin
2. Set obsidian-git options
3. Close and re-open the vault

1. I think I have the pattern req'd for using Obsidian with 11ty-garden
2. next steps
  2.1. verify git push/pull working
  2.2. clean up some of the notes? and maybe the index.md file?
  2.3. attempt the Netlify steps
